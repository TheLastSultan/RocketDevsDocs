# Hiring Guide
Welcome to RocketDevs' Hiring Guide! This guide is designed to assist companies in making informed decisions when hiring developers through RocketDevs' platform. Whether you are a startup looking for technical talent or an established company seeking to augment your engineering team, this guide will provide valuable insights and considerations between our three competency levels (L1, L2, and L3).

### **L1 (0-2 years of experience) - Associate Level**
Choose an L1 when:  

1. **Junior-Level Experience**: You are open to hiring individuals who are early in their software development careers, typically with 0-2 years of experience.
2. **Cost Optimization**: You have budget constraints and are looking for a cost-effective solution without compromising on quality.
3. **Skill Development**:  You are willing to invest in skill development. At a minimum, we assess our L1s for competence in their domains. Nevertheless, L1s do their best work when they are supported by more experienced developers at the L2 and L3 levels.
4. **Team Collaboration**: You value their fresh perspectives, adaptability, and enthusiasm, which can contribute to a collaborative team environment. Most developers agree that the first years of Software Development are the most passionate years! Am I wrong?
