# RocketLevel Hiring Guide
When browsing RocketDevs a company can choose the caliber of developer annotated by RocketLevels. This guide is designed to assist companies in making informed decisions when hiring developers through RocketDevs' platform. Whether you are a startup looking for technical talent or an established company seeking to augment your engineering team, this guide will provide valuable insights and considerations between our three competency levels (L1, L2, and L3).

### **L1 (1 Rocket: 0-2 years of experience)[~$980/mo] - Associate Level**
Choose an L1 when:  

1. **Junior-Level Experience**: You are open to hiring individuals who are early in their software development careers, typically with 0-2 years of experience.
2. **Cost Optimization**: You have budget constraints and are looking for a cost-effective solution without compromising on quality.
3. **Skill Development**:  You are willing to invest in skill development. At a minimum, we assess our L1s for competence in their domains. Nevertheless, L1s do their best work when they are supported by more experienced developers at the L2 and L3 levels.
4. **Team Collaboration**: You value their fresh perspectives, adaptability, and enthusiasm, which can contribute to a collaborative team environment. Most developers agree that the first years of Software Development are the most passionate years! Am I wrong?

### **L2 (2 Rockets: 2-4 years of experience)[~$1650/mo] - Mid-Senior Level**
Choose an L2 when:

1. **Intermediate Expertise**: You need a developer with a firm grasp of software development principles and a proven track record. While they might not have the breadth of experience as an L3, they've successfully tackled a variety of challenges and can handle moderately complex projects.
2. **Collaborative Development**: They are often well-suited to working as part of a larger team, complementing both junior and more experienced developers.
3. **Architectural Input**: While they might not be the chief architects, L2 developers can offer valuable input on system design based on their experience with different tools and methods.
4. **Problem Solving**: You're seeking someone who can efficiently troubleshoot and solve problems as they arise, drawing from their growing bank of experience.
5. **Stakeholder Communication**: They can effectively communicate with peers and may have started interfacing with stakeholders, although might not yet be as adept as an L3 in aligning technical solutions with broader organizational goals.
